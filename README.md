# fast_heirarchical_document_clustering
Hierarchical document clustering based on document topic. Clustering is performed using TF-IDF representations of documents with several speed improvements.

This project is based on a class project for CSCD 530 Big Data Analytics at Eastern Washington University in winter quarter of 2021.
That project was a collaboration with Will Hall and the repo can be found [here](https://github.com/use/cord19clustering).
